Building websites with Oxygen? Your work will get easier & faster with this Toolbar Extras Add-On. Extended plugin support baked right in.

== Description ==

🚀 Quick Access to Your Oxygen Site Building Resources - Big Time Saver. Perfect for Non-Techies and Non-Coder Designers.  
This smart WordPress plugin just adds some missed and **very useful Oxygen-specific admin links** to your Toolbar / Admin Bar. Save scrolling travel and time. Access settings and content pages faster from one central area in the Admin Dashboard AND when on the frontend of your site. Plus few optimizations for Oxygen's own Toolbar within the Builder :-).

ℹ️ **Essential:** Toolbar Extras for Oxygen Builder is an **Add-On** plugin, it **requires** the base plugin "Toolbar Extras".  
ℹ️ **Important:** "Oxygen Builder" is a **premium** plugin for WordPress by Soflyy.  
ℹ️ **Disclaimer:** Toolbar Extras for Oxygen Builder is an **independent** free plugin by David Decker from DECKERWEB. It does **not** represent Soflyy/ Oxygen.

= ♥️ Features - What the Plugin Does =
* **More links for the "Back to WP" section** in Oxygen Builder interface itself -- Oxygen Templates, WordPress Pages, WooCommerce Products, Oxygen User Elements Library
* Optionally open those **"Back to WP" links in a new tab/ window** -- perfect for **previewing** your templates/ pages ...
* Useful **Row action "Edit with Oxygen"** for all Oxygen Template post types, plus any item of an Oxygen-enabled post type that contains an Oxygen Element already
* Useful **Post State "Oxygen"** appended to all post type items edited with Oxygen - for example for Pages
* Registers Oxygen Builder - **set as default Builder** for the "Build" Group
* Adds Oxygen Templates **links to the "Build" Group** in the Toolbar, including Reusable Parts and User Elements Library (2.3+)
* Label tweaks and additions for Oxygen Templates in the "New Content" Group
* Adds Website install wizard/ Importer to the Toolbar "Build" Group as well - for faster access
* Adds all Oxygen settings and settings tabs links to the Toolbar
* Adds links to settings of Oxygen Add-On Plugins (only if these are active)
* Adds lots of official and Community resources to the Toolbar (optional, can be disabled via settings) - documentation, forum, Facebook Group etc.
* Frontend only: The original Oxygen Toolbar item can be customized - icon, location, label
* Add additional view to filter Oxygen Reusable Parts only - in Templates post type list table (overview table)
* Proper highlighting of Templates submenu in Oxygen's admin menu - so you always know where you are
* Adds new tab on plugin's settings page (under "Settings > Toolbar Extras > Tab: Oxygen") so you have control over what is displayed and what's not!

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is Oxygen Builder required for this plugin? =
Technically Oxygen Builder is not required. However, without Oxygen Builder being activated this Add-On plugin (Toolbar Extras for Oxygen Builder) doesn't make any sense at all. That means, without Oxygen active, no items, settings etc. will be loaded at all.

I totally [recommend Oxygen Builder](https://toolbarextras.com/go/oxygen/) - so, with it active, this plugin here will make the perfect sense, helping you save time, scrolling travel and getting you more productive.


= Will other third-party Oxygen Plugins be supported? =
Yes, absolutely. - Every Oxygen-specific plugin or Add-On will be supported as long as it has a settings page or comes with a post type screen or similar.


= Why is the Administrator Role required? =
This Add-On plugin only works and makes sense for Administrator users (and Super Admins in Multisite) just because the links it adds to the Toolbar normally do require those permissions for the original supported plugins.

Example: The Oxygen Builder settings page requires the capability `manage_options` - by default, only Administrators have this capability. So Toolbar Extras for Oxygen Builder "inherits" those capabilities (permissions) as well.

So, to see anything added to the Toolbar, it is required the user must have the capabilities of `manage_options` and `edit_theme_options`. As long as these are in place, Toolbar Extras is the perfect companion! :-)

(Note: Implementing other roles/ capabilities is not planned, and it makes no sense, really. It would require the codebase to be bloated with all those additional permission conditions and would give only very very few (if any at all!) additional links for roles like "Editor" or lower. Again, offering all items only for Admins follows the supported integrations, prevents bloat and big footprint while also avoiding very high maintenance costs.)


= Does the Plugin work with the new Block Editor (Gutenberg)? =
Yes, absolutely. Since the Toolbar has no direct connection to the editor anyways, it is fully compatible by default. Oxygen Builder and the Block Editor (Gutenberg) work totally fine together. And Toolbar Extras, the base plugin, also has special integration features for the Block Editor.


= Will this Plugin slow down my site? =
**Absolutely not.** The plugin will only do its stuff for logged-in Administrator users. It does nothing for visitors of your site. And, the plugin loads its stuff only when needed and if supported third-party plugins are active. Plugin was built to be as lightweight as possible.


= How can I disable the link attributes (tooltips)? =
This is easily possible within the "General" settings of Toolbar Extras. Just go to the "General" tab and set options for the link behavior. -- Note: This setting also applies to the "Back to WP" section in Oxygen Builder interface itself.

Settings > Toolbar Extras > Tab: "General" > Section: "Links Behavior"


= Where are more settings? =
A lot more settings are available via the base plugin, Toolbar Extras. This opens up a lot of customization options and tweaks for you.


= Does the Plugin work with Multisite? =
Yes, it works fine in Multisite, you could even activate it Network-wide. However, it does add almost nothing additional to the Network Admin but rather to the Dashboard of each individual sub-site of the Network. Therefore I recommend to use "Toolbar Extras" only in single installs (default) currently.


= More info on Translations? =

* English - default, always included
* German (de_DE): Deutsch - immer dabei! :-)
* For custom and update-safe language files please upload them to `/wp-content/languages/toolbar-extras-oxygen/` (just create this folder) - This enables you to use fully custom translations that won't be overridden on plugin updates. Also, complete custom English wording is possible with that as well, just use a language file like `toolbar-extras-oxygen-en_US.mo/.po` to achieve that (for creating one see the following tools).

**Easy WordPress.org plugin translation platform with GlotPress platform:** [**Translate "Toolbar Extras"...**](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/toolbar-extras-oxygen)

*Note:* All my plugins are internationalized/ translateable by default. This is very important for all users worldwide. So please contribute your language to the plugin to make it even more useful. For translating and validating I recommend the awesome ["Poedit Editor"](https://www.poedit.net/), which works fine on Windows, macOS and Linux.
